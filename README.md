# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-Model

This project aims to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. With the growing risks associated with online payment systems, this project explores various anomaly detection algorithms to identify unauthorized transactions and mitigate potential fraud.

### Key Features:
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Comprehensive analysis and preparation of a synthetic dataset to uncover patterns and enhance data quality.
- **Feature Engineering:** Development of new features to improve the detection capabilities of the models by examining transaction behaviors.
- **Anomaly Detection Models:** Implementation of multiple anomaly detection algorithms, including Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoder Neural Network, and Elliptical Envelope, to identify fraudulent transactions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Thorough assessment of models using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to determine the most effective algorithm for fraud detection.

This project provides a comparative analysis of the chosen algorithms, offering insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of online payment fraud detection.
